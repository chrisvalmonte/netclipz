## About
I wrote server-side code to store a list of movies, including box art imagery and movie trailer URLs. I then served this data as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers.

## Running The Application
Using a Python IDE like IDLE, run the `all_movies.py` module.

## Contributing
I will not accept any pull requests.

## Dependencies
* `Python 2.7`
* `netclipz.py`, originally `fresh_tomatoes.py` pulled from starter project.
* `Bootstrap 3.1.0`
* `JQuery 1.10.1`
